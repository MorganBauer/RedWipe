Erase Your Reddit History

Red Wipe is a utility designed to automatically remove ALL your Reddit comments and posts permanently.
Reddit has stated in the past that even when you delete your comments and posts the last copy is saved
on their servers. This applies to when you delete your account as well. Red Wipe will edit all text
comments and posts to random data before deletion. This may prevent the original messages from being
recovered.
